## MRC CANOE MARATHON RESULTS APP

This app was designed to make canoe marathon race results more accessible and useful.

Racers, coaches, clubs and parents can use it as a record of their racing results, or learn more about different races and competitors.

The data behind this app also gives the MRC a powerful tool to analyse and understand participation over time, by region and among different groups of people and craft.

If you want a copy of the database please email marathon.secretary@britishcanoeing.org.uk
